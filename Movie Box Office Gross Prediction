The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the box office gross revenue of movies based on various attributes and indicators. We are provided with two datasets: "tmdb_5000_movies.csv" and "tmdb_5000_credits.csv." These datasets have been prepared by scraping movie-related data from the IMDB website, covering a time span from 1916 to 2017.
To predict the revenue of movies, we will leverage these datasets and employ various machine learning techniques and algorithms. This prediction can assist various stakeholders in the film industry, including production companies, distributors, and investors, to make informed decisions about resource allocation, marketing strategies, and revenue forecasting.
Throughout the project, we will emphasize data exploration, model interpretation, and practical application of the results. By accurately predicting movie box office gross revenue, we aim to contribute to the understanding of the factors that influence movie success and provide valuable insights to stakeholders in the film industry.
